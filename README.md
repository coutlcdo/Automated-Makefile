# Automated Makefile script

This project is a directory watcher to automate the process of creating Makefiles for Allegro projects, it can be easily adapted to fulfill other purposes though.

## Running locally

To run locally you just compile the c file using `gcc` for example, but you'll have to change some file paths on the code before. Despite the name, it isn't yet fully automated.
